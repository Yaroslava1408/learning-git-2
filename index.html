                        <br>Not all those who wander are lost;
                        <br>The old that is strong does not wither,
                        <br>Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
                            <br>
                        <br>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
                        <br>A light from the shadows shall spring;
                        <br>Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
                        <br>The crownless again shall be king.
